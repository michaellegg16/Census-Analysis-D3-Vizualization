# **D3-Challenge**

### Task

* Use data based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates ([CensusData](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2014/1-year.html)) to investigate health risks facing certain demographics i.e. Percent of the population that smokes and average annual income.

1. To run the code, simply run the 'index.html' file with a local live server. This code is for testing purposes only and has not been deployed.


### Conclusion

Based on this analysis, Utah had the lowest amount of smokers but also the lowest average annual income. States such as Kentucky and West Virgina had the highest smoker percentages and lowest average annual incomes. The chart shows somewhat of a inverse curve, with states clustered towards lower smoker percentages and higher average incomes. Smoker percentage increases as average annual income decreases. Utah had the lowest smoker percentage of 9.7% and West Virginia had the highest percentage at 26.7%. The highest average annual income was $73,971 in Maryland and the lowest average annual income in Missouri at $39,680.
